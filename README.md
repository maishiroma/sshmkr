> This README is a WIP! 

## Project Goals
- Create a SSH Manager that not only helps streamline adding config to your `~/.ssh/config`, but also can utilize templates within your `~/.ssh/config` to help streamline adding new config options!
- Doing the above, BUT also support formatting your `~/.ssh/config` to abid by your comments!
- Dabble into `go`
- Something to work on while I'm at work!
